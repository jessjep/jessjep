<h1 align=center> ✨ Hello ✨ </h1>

I'm interested in effective data visualization.

I’m currently working on a blog/portfolio to showcase my growing number of personal projects. (jessjep.github.io)

I rely primarily on ggplot2 and the tidyverse in R to create my visualisations, but am learning more tools and techniques as I go.
