Hi, I'm Jess ðŸ‘‹

I worked as a copy editor for several years, and have an educational background in psychology and statistics. I love making complex data accessible to everyone, bridging the gap between experts and non-experts. Some of my inspirations include [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), the work of [Federica Fragapane](https://www.behance.net/FedericaFragapane), and the [Tidy Tuesday learning community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

Right now, Iâ€™m working on improving my data visualization skills. I enjoy experimenting with style and finding creative ways to present data that not only communicate information clearly but also encourage curiosity and further thought.

I share my projects knowing theyâ€™re not always perfect, as a way to challenge perfectionism and keep progressing my learning.
