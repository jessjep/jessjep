Hi, I'm Jess ðŸ‘‹

I write about data for the Australian government. I worked as a copy editor for several years, and have an educational background in psychology and statistics. 

Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on building my data visualization skills in R by participating in #TidyTuesday. I enjoy experimenting with style and finding creative ways to present data that not only communicate information clearly but also encourage curiosity and further thought.

I share my projects knowing theyâ€™re not always perfect, as a way to challenge my perfectionist tendencies and keep progressing my learning.
