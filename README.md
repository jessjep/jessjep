<h1 align=center> Hello ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

I'm interested in effective data visualization.

Iâ€™m currently working on a blog/portfolio to showcase my growing number of personal projects.

I rely primarily on ggplot2 and the tidyverse in R to create my visualisations, but am learning more tools and techniques as I go.
