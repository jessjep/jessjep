Hi, I'm Jess 👋

I love making complex data accessible to everyone, bridging the gap between experts and non-experts. Some of my inspirations include [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), the work of [Federica Fragapane](https://www.behance.net/FedericaFragapane), and the [Tidy Tuesday learning community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

Right now, I’m working on improving my data visualization skills. I enjoy experimenting with style and finding creative ways to present data.
