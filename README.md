Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm interested in effective data visualization.

Iâ€™m currently working on a personal website to showcase my growing number of projects (which I make in my free time). I'd like to branch into the field professionally someday.

I primarily use ggplot2 and the tidyverse in R to create my visualisations.
